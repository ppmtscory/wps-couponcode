h1. Coupon Code

You'll need to login to www.paypal.com to create your non-hosted buttons.

* Create a buy now button at full price and use that as your default.
* Set the $business value as the email address of your PayPal account.
* Set The default full price by assigning it to the $amount variable this should match the price for the button you just created at paypal.com
* Create additional buttons at www.paypal.com and apply discounts through the HTML Variables.  See our screencast on how to apply discounts with HTML variables.
* Add the appropriate discount amounts to the array.  
* Note, this example is using a fixed discount amount.
* If you want to use a percentage discount, update this code $amount = ($amount - $discount) to $amount = ($amount - ($amount * .$discount));

&lt;?php

	$business = "";
	$amount = 1;

	$arr = array(
	"take5" => array("discount" => "0.50"),
	"take10" => array("discount" => "0.75")
	);

	foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {

		if ($key == $_POST["couponCode"])
		{
